## 3. Known Bugs ##
* In chores, if a user is assigned to a chore, and leaves the suite, they will not disappear from the chore they 
* were previously assigned to. And afterwards when the chore is marked as done they will still be in the rotation of
* people who can be assigned to the chore. 
* 
* Similarly in chores if a chore is created, and new members are added to the suite, the list of people will not update
* for the old chore, leaving the original members in the rotation without the newer members.
